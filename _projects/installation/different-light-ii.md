A generative architectural projection intervention commissioned by Fusion Arts for 
Oxfordshire History Centre, a former church. _In A Different Light II_ was commissioned
as part of I, Cowley, a Heritage Lottery Fund supported creative heritage project.

The projection developed from In A Different Light and similarly made use of archive
and contemporary photographs of Cowley people, collected during the I, Cowley project.
These photographs were processed into digital line drawings, and juxtaposed with random
fragments of text from historic documents. Each juxtaposition of text and image
(there were many thousand possibilities) suggested a new story.

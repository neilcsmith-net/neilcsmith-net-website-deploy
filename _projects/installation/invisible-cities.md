_Invisible Cities_ was a collaboration with Oxford-based artist Helen Ganly. This projection 
work uses photographs of urban and rural landscapes from around the world, collected by Helen 
over a 15 year period, as the source material for a continuously evolving projected montage.

Helen and I share an interest in the ephemeral - in the fragility and instability inherent 
in the world around us. For many years, Helen's work has been inspired by the 1972 novel 
_Invisible Cities_ by Italo Calvino. Helen's earlier work appropriating this title was a 
slow dissolve presentation of 68 slides collected over a fifteen year period. This new version, 
uses digital scans of these images with a customised version of the image engine I originally 
developed for _Strata_. Projected live from a computer, continuously regenerating slowly 
evolving layers of montage, each moment is unique and ephemeral, recorded only by the memory
of the viewer.

Helen Ganly was born in Cookham, Berkshire in 1940 and studied at the Slade School of Fine Art
between 1958 and 1962. She taught for ten years at The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art
and in the Education Department of Oxford Brookes University. In the year 2000 she was given a
Year of the Artist award to be the first Artist-in-Residence at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

**Look into the eyes of a county’s people - and see yourself**

_Magoria_ is a generative screen work commissioned by Faces of Oxfordshire and curated 
by Tom Freshwater. It was commissioned as part of events to celebrate 1000 years of
Oxfordshire and its people.

> Exciting to watch never knowing what’s coming next. Nervous anticipation of the next montage.
> Beautiful and creepy at the same time. Everything that is right with modern art.
> (Ali, exhibition visitor at Cornerstone, Didcot)

The work generates a continuously evolving montage of faces from historical and contemporary
photographic portraits of the people of Oxfordshire. The name is in tribute to _phantasmagoria_,
an early 19th-century optical illusion that presented ghostly apparitions using projections and glass.

_Magoria_ toured various Oxfordshire venues between 2007 and 2009, collecting further
contemporary portraits of Oxfordshire people as it travelled. It is now permanently installed
in Oxfordshire Museum, Woodstock - returning to the venue at which it was first shown.

Historic portraits were used with the support and permission of Oxfordshire Studies.
Supported by Arts Council England and Oxfordshire County Council.

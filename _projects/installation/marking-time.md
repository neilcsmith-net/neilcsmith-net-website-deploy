A series of interactive digital installations commissioned by [Dancin' Oxford](https://www.dancinoxford.co.uk)
for Oxford Castle Quarter. _Marking Time_ was developed in collaboration with dance artists Naomi Morris and Kate Willis,
and was the first Digital Prisoners project.

All of the installations were site-responsive and reflected the history of the site as
Oxford's former prison; drawing inspiration from the mundanity of prison life, the chores
that prisoners were forced to carry out, and the idea that time weighs heavy when one is
deprived of freedom.

> Inspiring show, evoking & emotional. Thanks for bringing it to Oxford.  
> (Hannah DC)

The installations were designed to be interacted with by the public and by performance.
There were 8 improvised performances over the two days the project was open to the public.

I was the lead artist on this project, which was also intended as a professional development
opportunity for dance artists to get experience with interactive digital technology.

As Digital Prisoners with Naomi Morris

_A public square, a projector, two cameras, two strangers, one dance_

A cinematic transformation of a public square, _Meeting Point_ allows two strangers to dance
together remotely from opposite sides of the space. Their combined movement, captured,
merged and creatively manipulated, is projected onto a single point in the urban landscape.

_Meeting Point_ was originally commissioned by Dancin' Oxford in 2013 for Bonn Square in central Oxford.
In 2014 we were re-commissioned to develop a new version, with eight new scenes. The 2014 version
incorporated music from a variety of Oxford musicians including Tiger Mendoza, Flights of Helios,
Ben Mowat and Lee Christian.

The work uses uses two infra-red CCTV cameras, custom computer software and a large-scale projector.
It allows the two participants to interact with each other and, through motion detection, with the
other audio and visual elements of each section.

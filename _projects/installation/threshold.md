A sound generating intervention across the doorway leading into Departure Gallery's
group exhibition Trident Way in a large, semi-derelict warehouse in Southall.

One of the simplest works I've created, _Threshold_ echoed the PVC strip 
doors often found in warehouses. The semi-translucent plastic strips, giving just a
tantalising glimpse of what lay beyond, were mic'ed up using a contact microphone.
The sound of the audience moving through the threshold to enter or leave the space
was processed using simple digital processing, and thundered out across the cavernous
space of the warehouse.

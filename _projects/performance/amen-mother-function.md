One sample, one function – a live-coded, single function demolition of the most
ubiquitous sample in modern music. This performance work is both an essay in
conceptual minimalism and an attempt at filling the dance floor with the aid of 
one wavetable and a little maths.

The silent $ in the title (also used in the code), is in tribute to Gregory C. Coleman,
the original drummer of the Amen break, who died homeless and broke.

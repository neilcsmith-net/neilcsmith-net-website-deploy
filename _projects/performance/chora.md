_Chora_ is the sound of Darwin - the algorithm that creates design out of chaos.
A choir of independent electronic voices sing and listen to each other. Starting from 
a common 'seed', phrases evolve through the Darwinian algorithm of inheritance, mutation 
and selection as they are passed from voice to voice. In a (very) limited parallel with 
humans, each voice's selection pressure develops from its memory of past events. However,
just like many of us, their memory isn't perfect and they can't manage two things at once!

The first version of _Chora_ was presented outdoors at night on the Brookes campus, and had
a duration of 10 min. A line of flaming torches separated the audience from the sound sources.
The torches were deliberately chosen to echo the use of fire as protection against the night. 
I was imagining how in earlier times people might listen enthralled but wary to the sounds
of wild creatures at night, except that these creatures have a distinctly human sound, and maybe
it's our own animal nature we're wary of.

_Chora_ was revisited and reworked for the Soundworks 2005 festival during Cork's Capital of
Culture year. Performances occurred over four nights in Emmet Place in the centre of Cork,
engaging well with the passing public. These performances were promoted by ArtTrail
with the support of Cork Opera House and the Crawford Gallery.

Over the last year I've been working on a couple of new improvised live-coding performance
pieces using [Praxis LIVE](/software/).

## AMEN $ Mother Function

One sample, one function â€“ a live-coded, single function demolition of the most
ubiquitous sample in modern music. This new performance work is both an essay in
conceptual minimalism and an attempt at filling the dance floor with the aid of 
one wavetable and a little maths.

The silent $ in the title (also used in the code), is in tribute to Gregory C. Coleman,
the original drummer of the Amen break, who died homeless and broke.

## Temperamental Recursions

This piece is created by feeding back electromagetic noise captured from the laptop
using a telephone pickup coil, and passing it through various live-coded filters to
create all of the sound. Data from the audio is also used to control visual aspects of
the performance.

The first live performance of this piece was in October 2016 in Hamilton, Canada,
alongside my paper on Praxis LIVE at the International Conference on Live Coding.

Over recent months I've been working on a couple of new improvised live-coding performance
pieces using [Praxis LIVE](/software/).

## Temperamental Recursions

This piece is created by feeding back electromagetic noise captured from the laptop
using a telephone pickup coil, and passing it through various live-coded filters to
create all of the sound. Data from the audio is also used to control visual aspects of
the performance.

The first live performance of this piece was in October 2016 in Hamilton, Canada,
alongside my paper on Praxis LIVE at the International Conference on Live Coding.

## AMEN $ Mother Function

Still in development, this performance explores what can be achieved with just one sample
and one function - a live-coded demolition of one of the most ubiquitous loops in modern
music.

Takes a little while to get going!

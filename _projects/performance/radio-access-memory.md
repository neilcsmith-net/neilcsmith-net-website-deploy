_Radio Access Memory_ came about through a desire to merge the worlds of live electronic
sound improvisation with plunderphonics. A term coined by Canadian composer John Oswald, 
plunderphonics refers to the use of other people's recordings as raw material for creating 
new music. Thus plunderphonics is a creative process that is openly derivative. In a lot of
plunderphonic work, source material is chosen for its extra-musical associations as well as 
its musical qualities, and the choice of source material has a strong aesthetic meaning within 
the work. With _Radio Access Memory_ I wanted to remove most of this layer of source choice,
and instead create the work out of whatever sound can be taken from the radio at the time 
of the performance - the only choice of source material being through the radio frequency dial. 
Inspired by the texts of post-modernist commentator Arthur Kroker, who amongst others posits
the view of digital sampling as an extension of human memory, this piece is intended as a
metaphor for the way we juxtapose and manipulate music we have heard in the creation of new work.

Through the performance, fragments of music and spoken word are captured in real-time from across
the radio spectrum. These fragments are looped and juxtaposed, sliced and manipulated. I try to
take the audience on the journey as the sound changes, allowing them to hear the transformations 
as the sound evolves away from its original form, and placing the derivative nature of creating 'on display'.
As the performance progresses, fragments are recorded (remembered), combined, manipulated and 
discarded (forgotten), emphasising the parallels between sampling and human memory. Because there
are only four loop samplers, which store their recordings in RAM (volatile memory), older sounds
must be discarded to make way for new sounds, and at the end of the performance all sounds are lost,
leaving only the memory in the minds of the audience and myself.

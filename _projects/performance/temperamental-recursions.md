A live-coded performance created by feeding back electromagnetic noise captured from the laptop
using a telephone pickup coil, and passing it through various live-coded filters to
create all of the sound. Data from the audio is also used to control visual aspects of
the performance.

The first live performance of this piece was in October 2016 in Hamilton, Canada,
alongside my paper on [PraxisLIVE](https://www.praxislive.org) at the International Conference on Live Coding.

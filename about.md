_exploring new ecologies of creation_

My work explores ways of opening up and challenging the nature of creativity itself,
in particular through the use of technology. Working sonically and visually, solo and
in collaboration, I create live improvised performances, and context-specific generative 
and interactive installations. Breaking away from familiar uses of technology as a reproductive
medium, much of my work exists in real-time and real-space - each moment a unique and 
unrepeatable experience.

I also work as a technologist, specialising in developing and supporting free
open-source technology. In 2019 I founded [Codelerity Ltd.](https://www.codelerity.com)
to pursue this work. Codelerity offer software development, consultancy and advice. We
focus on real-time systems, real-time programming, media, embedded and tools on
the JVM.

_exploring new ecologies of creation_

My work explores ways of opening up and challenging the nature of creativity itself,
in particular through the use of technology. Working sonically and visually, solo and
in collaboration, I create live improvised performances, and context-specific generative 
and interactive installations. Breaking away from familiar uses of technology as a reproductive
medium, much of my work exists in real-time and real-space - each moment a unique and 
unrepeatable experience.

Integrally related to my artistic practice, I also work as a technologist with
artists and organisations, specialising in developing and supporting free open-source technology.

Alongside my freelance work, I've worked in various posts across the arts & voluntary sectors, 
including spending 5 years as Arts Officer (Strategic Development) at Oxford City Council. I am now
a director at [Eye Division Ltd.](http://www.eyedivision.com/) developing websites and applications
for education, charity, arts and business. I particularly specialise in Drupal and Jekyll based development.

I have developed and worked with free and open-source software for almost 20 years.
In 2019 I founded [Codelerity Ltd.](https://www.codelerity.com) to help support
these projects. Codelerity offer software development, consultancy and advice. We
focus on real-time systems, real-time programming, media, embedded and tools on
the JVM.

## PraxisLIVE / PraxisCORE

PraxisLIVE is a hybrid visual IDE and framework for live programming, rethinking
general purpose and creative coding. It was also used to develop and run many of
the [projects](/projects/) showcased on this site.

PraxisCORE is a modular JVM runtime for cyberphysical programming, supporting
real-time coding of real-time systems. It is the heart of PraxisLIVE. With a
distributed forest-of-actors architecture, runtime code changes and comprehensive
introspection, PraxisCORE brings aspects of Erlang, Smalltalk and Extempore
into the Java world ... a powerful platform for media processing, data visualisation,
sensors, robotics, IoT, and lots more!

PraxisLIVE is free, cross-platform and open-source. Find out more or download it
from [www.praxislive.org](http://www.praxislive.org).

## GStreamer-Java

GStreamer is a popular open-source multimedia framework. In 2015 I took on the job
of porting the existing GStreamer-Java bindings to support GStreamer 1.x. Codelerity
now lead development of these bindings, used in a variety of open-source and
commercial projects, including PraxisLIVE.

## Apache NetBeans

PraxisLIVE is built on top of the NetBeans IDE. I am a member of the Apache
NetBeans project management committee, and also a member of the Apache Software
Foundation. Recently, I have mostly been involved with NetBeans' release process
and acted as release manager for multiple releases.

## JAudioLibs

JAudioLibs is a collection of open-source Java libraries providing various audio
utilities I originally developed or ported for PraxisLIVE, including a Java binding
to the [JACK Audio Connection Kit](http://jackaudio.org/). These utilities are now
used by a variety of other projects.

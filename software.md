## Praxis LIVE

My primary software project is Praxis LIVE, a hybrid visual IDE and framework for 
live creative coding. It is used to develop and run most of the recent [projects](/projects/)
showcased on this site.

Praxis LIVE is free, cross-platform and open-source. Find out more or download it
from [www.praxislive.org](http://www.praxislive.org).

## JAudioLibs

JAudioLibs is a collection of open-source Java libraries providing various audio utilities 
I originally developed or ported for Praxis LIVE, including a Java binding to the 
[JACK Audio Connection Kit](http://jackaudio.org/). These utilities are now used by
a variety of other audio projects.

## GStreamer-Java

GStreamer is a popular open-source multimedia framework. In 2015 I took on the job of porting
the existing GStreamer-Java bindings to support GStreamer 1.x. I am now the lead maintainer 
for these bindings, used in a variety of open-source and commercial projects, including Praxis LIVE.
